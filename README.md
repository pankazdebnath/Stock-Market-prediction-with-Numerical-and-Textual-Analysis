# Stock-Market-prediction-with-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis
Prediction of the stock price using LSTM, of Microsoft with Historical data from: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history?p=MSFT , and Textual data from: https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

***If you want to practice this project from this repository then this Instractions you should follow.***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Find the used packages and install them in your system
2. It has done on Colab this is why you need to mount Google Drive and store the data files to the Drive
3. For texual analysis you must have 'nltk' installed and need to download 'vader_lexicon' from the package
4. For deep learning model(LSTM) I used 'TensorFlow.Keras' package, it also can be done by stock 'Keras' package

*best of luck for practicing
